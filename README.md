**Project Description**

At the start of this project, we sought to examine the correlations between numerous factors and player performance. We hoped that data mining game events would reveal correlations that are not expected or easily identifiable. And We wanted to investigate which factors contribute most to player performance.

We wanted to focus on “outside” factors such as weather, stadium attendance, and field condition. The results show correlations of varying significance between player performance and other factors. We intended to evaluate a few player performance metrics, but as the project progressed, we realized that we needed to narrow our scope. Thus, the player performance metric we decided to focus on is batting average. The outside factors we examined, ordered from highest correlation to batting average to lowest correlation, are temperature, field condition, precipitation, wind direction, attendance, day vs. night, wind speed, and sky conditions. Based on the correlation results, we may be able to infer causation on player performance. 

In our literature survey, we found that there has been a rather extensive amount of research on evaluating individual players, which makes sense. Producing that data and selling it to recruiters or scouts proves to be quite valuable, and in fact, most professional teams employ a professional statistician to do reports and research in this exact field. However, less research has been conducted regarding general player performance (performance of all players, not just one), and the factors that affect it. For this reason, we wanted to investigate factors that have not been extensively researched. 

Because this study does not focus on individual players, the information gained would most likely be of interest to baseball enthusiasts. However, the knowledge that outside factors are correlated to batting average could be applied in sabermetric applications including player recruitment, predicting individual player performance given situational information, and forecasting game outcomes given the states of outside factors.
