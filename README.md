**Retrosheet Installation Instructions**

The Retrosheet.sql file contains the Retrosheet data required for this project. The file was taken from Professor Hoenigman's course CSCI 4831 - Sabermetrics. To install, first download the file. In MySQL Workbench, go to File->Run SQL Script, and select the *Retrosheet.sql* file. For Default Schema Name, type *Retrosheet*. Click Run. If the script worked, you should see the Retrosheet database added under Schemas on the left side of the MySQL workbench. In the query editor, you need to specify that you're using *Retrosheet* with the command *use Retrosheet;*
